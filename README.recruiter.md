# 📦 Product Catalog API

**A clean and production-ready backend API** showcasing **Spring Boot, MongoDB optimization, Redis caching, Elasticsearch fuzzy searching, and containerization with Docker**.

🚀 Built to demonstrate **backend best practices, clean architecture, and scalable design**.

---

## 🎯 Highlights

- **Clean Architecture**: monolith design (controller → service → repository → cache).

- **High Performance**: applied **Redis caching** to reduce response time (view all, filter by category).

- **Optimized Database**: designed **MongoDB indexes** for faster queries.

- **Search Ready**: planned **Elasticsearch integration** for fuzzy search & autocomplete.

- **Team Practices**: Git workflow with feature-branching, PR reviews, semantic commits.

- **Testing & Quality**:

    - ✅ 89 unit/integration tests.

    - ✅ **100% coverage** with JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers.
